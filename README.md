# tw-js-tests
JavaScript tests, doing scripts for TW. Initially started a long while ago (2016?) but now revisiting with new ideas and coding knowledge.

## Usage

Use something like [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh) (rip RawGit) to include the scripts using something like jQuery's `$.getScript(urlString)`.

### Usage note

If a script appears to be doing nothing, make sure you check the console for errors. If it is supposed to perform actions automatically (focus buttons, input values in fields, etc) then an initial user input is necessary, please click the page and run the script again.

## Disclaimer

I do not take any responsibility for possible bans, suspensions, reports, flags as bots, or whatever that might happen. I try to minimise detection by either operating fully client-side, only running calculations on visible data and displaying them or automating actions in manners similar to human behaviour. However, this might not be perfect and it is on **you, the user**, to verify that there is no problem with running the script.
